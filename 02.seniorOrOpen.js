/* The Western Suburbs Croquet Club has two categories of membership, Senior and Open.To be a senior, a member must be at least 55 years old and have a handicap greater than 7. In this croquet club, handicaps range from -2 to +26;

Input
Input will consist of a list of pairs. Each pair contains information for a single potential member. 
Information consists of an integer for the person's age and an integer for the person's handicap.

Output
Output will consist of a list of string values (in Haskell and C: Open or Senior) 
stating whether the respective member is to be placed in the senior or open category.

Example
input =  [[18, 20], [45, 2], [61, 12], [37, 6], [21, 21], [78, 9]]
output = ["Open", "Open", "Senior", "Open", "Open", "Senior"] */

// 1st solution
function openOrSenior(data) {
  let output = data.map((pair) => {
    if (pair[0] >= 55 && pair[1] > 7) {
      return "Senior";
    } else {
      return "Open";
    }
  });
  return output;
}

// 2nd solution
function openOrSenior(data) {
  return data.map(([age, handicap]) =>
    age > 54 && handicap > 7 ? "Senior" : "Open"
  );
}

console.log(
  openOrSenior([
    [45, 12],
    [55, 21],
    [19, -2],
    [104, 20],
  ])
);
// ['Open', 'Senior', 'Open', 'Senior']
